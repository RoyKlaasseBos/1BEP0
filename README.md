# Bachelor End Project - Eindhoven University of Technology

## Abstract
Reward based crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter allow founders to fund their project by selling perks to a relative large customer base. Drawing on a scraped dataset of 3652 campaigns with combined funding over $51M, this Bachelor End Project (BEP) discusses several underlying dynamics of successful crowdfunding. Empirical analyses show that the mean estimated delivery time of perks, creator’s past crowdfunding success rate, the creator’s adoption speed, the number of previous projects by the creator and the number of Facebook friends affect this success rate. Using these and other directly scrapeable attributes from Kickstarter, a binary classification model has been built to predict the success or failure of campaigns. Random Forests perform the best achieving an accuracy of 78.8% at campaign launch (20 percentage points above the baseline model). The practical implications of these findings for both Kickstarter and creators are discussed.
